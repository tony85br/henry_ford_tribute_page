   <div id="tribute-info">
         <p>Henry was born on a farm near Greenfield, Michigan on July 30th, 1863.</p>
         <p>Educated  in  the  Greenfield  school  district,  and  at  the  age  of 16  Henry  became  a  machinist's  apprentice  in  Detroit.</p>
         <p>In  1888  he married  Clara  Jane  Bryant.</p>
         <p>In  1891  he  became  an  engineer  at  the Edison  Illumination  Company  in  Detroit.</p>
         <p>Henry  had  one  son,  Edsel Bryant Ford, born in Detroit Nov. 6th, 1893.</p>
         <p>Henry built his first car, the "Quadricycle Runabout" in the summer of 1896.</p>
         <p>It had a 4 horse power engine and could reach 20mph.</p>
         <p>He sold the  car for $200.00 to finance his second  car which was completed around early 1898.</p>
         <p>Henry Ford did not invent the automobile.</p>
         <p>But more than any other single individual, he was responsible for transform-ing the automobile from an invention of unknown utility into an innovation that profoundly shaped the 20th century and continues to affect the 21st.</p>
         <p>Early on, Ford demonstrated some of the characteristics that would make him successful.</p>
         <p>In his family, he became infa-mous for taking apart his siblings’ toys as well as his own.</p>
         <p>He organized other boys to build rudimentary waterwheels and steam engines.</p>
         <p>He learned about full-size steam engines by becoming acquainted with the engines’ operators and pes-tering them with questions.</p>
         <p>He taught himself to fix watches and used the watches themselves as textbooks to learn the basics of machine design.</p>
         <p>Thus, at an early age Ford dem-onstrated curiosity, self-confidence, mechanical ability, the capacity for leadership and a preference for learning by trial and error.</p>
         <p>These characteristics would become the founda-tion of his whole career.</p>
